<h2>Installation:</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Unzip the package in an empty directory and upload everything.</li>
	<li>Open <span class="file"><a href="wp-admin/install.php">wp-admin/install.php</a></span> in your browser. It will take you through the process to set up a <code>wp-config.php</code> file with your database connection details.</li>
	<li>Once the configuration file is set up, the installer will set up the tables needed for your blog. If there is an error, double check your <code>wp-config.php</code> file, and try again. If it fails again, please open an issue at <a href="https://github.com/calmPress/calmpress/issues" title="calmPress support">bug tracker</a> with as much data as you can gather.</li>
	<li>The installer should then send you to the <a href="wp-login.php">login page</a>. Sign in with the email and password you specified during the installation.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Migrating from other systems</h2>
<p>calmPress utilizes the same database structure as WordPress and therefor you can use any of the relevant WordPress tools <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Importing_Content">to import from a number of systems</a>. First you need to get WordPress installed and working as described above, before using <a href="wp-admin/import.php" title="Import to WordPress">our import tools</a>.</p>

<h2>System Requirements</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://secure.php.net/">PHP</a> version <strong>7.4</strong> or higher.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> version <strong>5.7</strong> or higher.</li>
</ul>
